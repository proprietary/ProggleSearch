INSTALLATION

The quickest way, if you have Firefox and Greasemonkey, is to click the .user.js file right above this, and then click ``raw.'' Greasemonkey will handle the rest.

USAGE NOTES

Pretty self explanatory. Make sure to use the tooltips.

Only works with Firefox and Greasemonkey, for the time being

When the search is in progress, you may want to switch to another window. The requests are done synchronously, in the interests of not crashing the browser, and therefore will block the thread your tab is running on (or so it seems).
